# The-Design-Process
Assignment 2

## Discovery – High
Studying industrial design in college brought along many assignments involving products with flaws and the process of identifying the problems that needed to be improved, innovated or re-designed were cucial. During my senior thesis project our task was to identify a product/ product market and the problems associated. Thus discovering the problems that will lead to the products redesign. Specifically clarifying the problems that were most important to be addressed as well as those less important that will not be addressed.

## Strategy – Medium
Strategy depends on the task at hand but was usually underlined inside of a project brief.

## Information Architecture  - Medium 
The experience I have with this phase is a bit more organic. The strategy to gather information could range from user interviews, user observations, online statistics, and personal product experimentations.

## Visual Design – High
Visually speaking aesthetics come high on the list for product design. Many lessons were taken on visual design from fundamental classes like figure drawing, color theory, the golden ratio (gestalt principles), abode creative suite studies, ideation/concept sketching and 2D/3D rendering. Graphic design practices like logos, branding, and cover art are all things I do in my spare time as well.

## Development – Low
I have no prior knowledge of coding.
The development skills I have are within the realms of products. Developing foam models, prototype models, and all things that can replicate a physical form for testing. 

## Launch – Medium
I have experience in launching projects at school presentations where I had to present design work to my peers, classmates, and instructors. I also have experience presenting work to project managers at my previous design jobs through all stages of projects from start to production of products.
